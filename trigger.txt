/*Write PL/SQL block of code which implements concept of trigger. Use following tables schema-
1. library(bno ,bookname ,author ,alloweddays)
2. library_aud(bno ,old_days ,new_days)*/

1. LIBRARY table 
Creating table library

create table library(bno int,bookname varchar(20),author varchar(20),alloweddays int);
Inserting record into table
insert into library values(1,'toc','Rajeev Motwani',12);
insert into library values(2,'toc','sanjeev arora',25);
insert into library values(3,'dbms','s. sudarshab',2);
insert into library values(4,'sepm','roger pressman',20);

Retriving data from table
select *from library;

2. Creating table LIBRARY_AUD
create table library_aud(bno int,old_days int,new_days int);

3. Creating TRIGGER
create or replace trigger tr1
before update or delete on library
for each row

begin
 insert into library_aud values(:new.bno,:old.alloweddays,:new.alloweddays);
end;

4. Performing Operations on Library table
Updation Operation
update library set alloweddays = 10 where bookname = 'dbms';
Deletion Operation
delete from library where alloweddays = 12;


5. LIBRARY table After Performing Operations 
select *from library;

6. Records in LIBRARY_AUD table
select *from library_aud;
